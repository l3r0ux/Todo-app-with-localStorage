# Todo-app-with-localStorage
https://local-storage-todo-list.herokuapp.com/index.html

This todo app remembers the todo lists and items you had in your browser, so if you close and open the website, your todos will still be there.

### Key Features:
- Fully responsive for mobile devices, just reload the app when you change the screen size on the fly so that the javascript can reload.
- Ability to add multiple todo lists, each with their own respective todo items.
- Can mark a todo item as complete, update, or delete it.
- Can drag and drop todo lists to where you want them, the browser remembers all the data on reload.
- Ability to add, remove or update a due date(may be omitted) so that the time left of the todo item will be shown on mouse hover
  and the respective todo item will be colored according to time left. Blue means there is a lot of time left,
  while red means there is very little time left. You can also omit the time input, and only provide a date, and
  it will still work.
- Data persistence of all settings: completed status, todo list location, whether fields were expanded or not etc.
